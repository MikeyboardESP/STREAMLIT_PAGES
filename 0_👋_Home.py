- 🧑‍💻 I´m currrently studying a master related to Big Data & Analytics, despite of my business-oriented background I feel comfortable trying everyday 
         Analytical tools such as PowerBI, R-Studio, MySql, Tableau, Excel, and naturally Python, from where I´m deploying my portfolio ."

- 🛩️ prev: I studied a degree in Economics at the University of Salamanca where I had the opportunity to delve into Economic Science
          and I it highly related with stadistics and Mathematical Analysis.
         
 -    🇵🇱  During 2020-2021, I had the opportunity (with some retrictions due to COVID-19) to have and extraodrinary Erasmus year in Wroclaw (Poland) Where I first started 
          enjoying being in multicultural environments, speaking in English daily (and sometimes even in polish). It wasn´t my first time having an immersive experience like that 
          because before starting the university, I had a student exchange for 3 weeks in Antioch (Chicago) living with an American family.

 -    🇩🇰  By the time I finished my degree, I lived for one year abroad before deciding on my next step. So I headed to Copenhaguen (Denmark), but before that, 
         I lived some time in Malmo (Sweeden), where I had the WorkAway experience, living with a very nice business couple. I had a fantastic opportunity to work for their company 
         in a very cool position as personal assitant for a celebrity man from the States. I learned a lot about solving daily problems, working efficiently, 
         dealing with different people every day, taking important decisions and achiving my targets.

- ❤️ I like doing sports, specially team sports such as football and Rugby which I played for 4 years in different teams. With my last team ADUS, we had the chance to win the univeristy cup in Seville.
          I have a daily routine for the gym, but what I really enjoy doing when I have time is unleashing my imagination and cooking very special dishes from any gastronomy, but specially Spanish and Japanese.
          I enjoy reading and watching MasterClass courses about psychology, history and personal growth. Due my analytical side playing/ studying poker and deploying EV+ strategies bring out the best part of me

- 🤖 in 2024, I´m developing a business with my sister, as she works as perfumist, we prepare a very special show called Bingo Olfativo where you can have a sensorial experience recognicing different 
         smells, mixing with the emotion of bingo, we have already done 8 shows in barcelona, Madrid and Zamora and the public recognices our merit.
         developing the business requires me financial knwoledge, acocuntability, excel skills, communicative skills, sales and marketing skills. 
         Furthermore, I developed a program with python to randomize the cardboards used during the bingo.
         You can find below the link to the instagram account!  "

-   ¿What am I looking for? I want to focus all my energy and potential in Big data, keep growing and learning about the science of the future, Connecting the business with Data Insights.
         Following a company that I feel ethical aligned with and having the capability to bring out the best part of me. 
         As I consider myself a very Outgoing person and easy to connect with I want to be the bridge between IT and business and become a problem-solver. 

-   ¿Where would i like to work? 
         *Copenahguen 
         *Barcelona
         *Madrid 
         *working in a different city in Spain or Europe works also for me
