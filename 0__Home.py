- üßë‚Äçüíª I am currently studying a master related to Big Data and Analytics. Despite my business-oriented background, I feel comfortable using analytical tools such as PowerBI, R-Studio, MySql, Tableau, Excel, and naturally Python, from where I am deploying my portfolio.

- üõ©Ô∏è Previous: I studied a degree in Economics at the University of Salamanca where I had the opportunity to delve into Economic Science and found it highly related to statistics and Mathematical Analysis.

- :flag-pl: During 2020-2021, I had the opportunity (with some restrictions due to COVID-19) to have an extraordinary Erasmus year in Wroclaw (Poland) where I first started enjoying being in multicultural environments, speaking in English daily (and sometimes even in Polish). It wasn't my first time having an immersive experience like that because before starting the university, I had a student exchange for 3 weeks in Antioch (Chicago) living with an American family.

- :flag-dk: By the time I finished my degree, I lived for one year abroad before deciding on my next step. So I headed to Copenhagen (Denmark), but before that, I lived some time in Malmo (Sweden), where I had the WorkAway experience, living with a very nice business couple. I had a fantastic opportunity to work for their company in a very cool position as a personal assistant for a celebrity man from the States. I learned a lot about solving daily problems, working efficiently, dealing with different people every day, taking important decisions, and achieving my targets.

- ‚ù§Ô∏è I like doing sports, especially team sports such as football and Rugby which I played for 4 years in different teams. With my last team ADUS, we had the chance to win the university cup in Seville. I have a daily routine for the gym, but what I really enjoy doing when I have time is unleashing my imagination and cooking very special dishes from any gastronomy, but especially Spanish and Japanese. I enjoy reading and watching MasterClass courses about psychology, history, and personal growth. Due to my analytical side, playing/studying poker and deploying EV+ strategies bring out the best part of me.

- ü§ñ In 2024, I am developing a business with my sister, as she works as a perfumist. We prepare a very special show called Bingo Olfativo where you can have a sensorial experience recognizing different smells, mixing with the emotion of bingo. We have already done 8 shows in Barcelona, Madrid, and Zamora, and the public recognizes our merit. Developing the business requires me financial knowledge, accountability, Excel skills, communicative skills, sales and marketing skills. Furthermore, I developed a program with Python to randomize the cardboards used during the bingo. You can find below the link to the Instagram account!
